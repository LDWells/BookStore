 This project uses a concept called Data Access Objects (DAO) that connects to a database. The results will be prodcued using a visual Graphical User
 Interface (GUI) to that database. A drop down is used in the gui as a dropdown box to see the list of books that an author made. A book can be searched either by author,
 publisher or category. The database tables used in this project are from the henry.sql file.
